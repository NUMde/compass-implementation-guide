# NUMCompassIG

This is the implementation guide for the FHIR Questionnaires used by the reference app framework developed in [NUM Compass](https://num-compass.science/de/), as well as the associated conformance testing frameworks for apps based on such questionnaires. It is based on the as-is state and supported features of the [native app](https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp-frontend) (developed by IBM) with additional documentation of the [GECCO](https://simplifier.net/ForschungsnetzCovid-19/) resource mapping extensions.

## Using Questionnaires in NUM-COMPASS
### Important constraints on the FHIR Questionnaire 

* Only JSON format is supported.
* `Questionnaire.url` and `Questionnaire.version` may not be empty. 
* The `Questionnaire.item` properties: `readOnly`, `answerValueSet` and `prefix` are not supported.
* `Questionnaire.item.repeats` is not supported for any `Questionnaire.item.type` other than `choice`. In case of `type = 'choice'` and `repeats = true`, a multiple choice list should be rendered.
* The `Questionnaire.item.type` quantity, dateTime, time, reference, attachment, openChoice is not supported. //TODO: Add constraint to the profile
* The first level of items must be of type "group"
* `Questionnaire.item.answerOption.value` must be either string or integer.
* `Questionnaire.item.enableWhen` is only permitted in combination with the equals-operator.

For more information on how the IBM reference app handles the Questionnaire resource, see the [frontend documentation of the reference app](https://github.com/NUMde/compass-numapp-frontend/tree/main/docs/questionnaireRendering).

### Additional hint:
* The item.type "choice" requires the item.answerOption-list to be of type "Coding". To create lists of strings or integers the user can choose from, use type = "string" or type = "integer" and a answerOption-list with valueString or valueInteger. See the discussion here: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179255-questionnaire/topic/type.3Dchoice.20and.20answerOption.2EvalueInteger.3F

### Supported extensions
* http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-questionnaire-itemcontrol.html ("slider" only)
* https://num-compass.science/fhir/StructureDefinition/LowRangeLabel
* https://num-compass.science/fhir/StructureDefinition/HighRangeLabel
* http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-sliderStepValue
* http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/minValue
* http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/maxValue

### Questionnaire.item-IDs 
* Because of the architecture of the IBM app, `linkId` must be of format "1.2.3" and determine order in Questionnaire. The parent's linkId must be a prefix of the child's linkId. It should be assigned automatically by the questionnaire editor.
* Because we can not choose the linkId freely, the extension `https://num-compass.science/fhir/StructureDefinition/CompassInterversionId` can be used to identify items across different versions.

In case of GECCO-Elements, there should some additional IDs be present:
* The extension `https://num-compass.science/fhir/StructureDefinition/CompassGeccoItem` identifies the item in the logical reference model.
* The `item.definition` element contains the url of the mapped profile.


### Questionnaire-IDs and Versioning
Besides the technical identifiers, which are stored in `Questionnaire.id` and `Questionnaire.identifier`, there is another "world-wide unique" identifier per Questionnaire, called `Questionnaire.url`. Often, the structure of the captured data (as described in the Questionnaire) is changed during the data capturing process. Therefore, FHIR provides the `Questionnaire.version` field to version the Questionnaire. Please note that this version is different from `Questionnaire.meta.versionId`, which corresponds to the FHIR repositories internal versioning.

The QuestionnaireResponse references its corresponding Questionnaire by `QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire`, which is a [canonical url](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/references.html#canonical). The FHIR standard allows appending the version to a canonical url by seperating it with a pipe (`|`) character. 

Even though the FHIR specification allows falling back to a local identifier, in this implementation guide, its `QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire` MUST correspond to `Questionnaire.url`. Implementers following this implementation guide MUST put the `Questionnaire.url` with the appended `Questionnaire.version`.

## Conformance testing

The conformance testing system is used to evaluate if test data generated by an app conforms to the GECCO standard. 

This IG contains profiles outlining the structure of the input and output for the conformance test HTTP endpoint. Below, we give high-level introductions to these formats. Users wishing to send their own data to the endpoint should consult the profiles themselves for the details.

### Input

The input to the conformance testing is a [FHIR Document](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/documents.html), i.e. a FHIR [Bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/bundle.html) of type "document" in which the first element is a [Composition resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/composition.html). The subsequent Bundle entries are resources indicating the name and publisher of the app to be tested, as well the set of resources to be tested for GECCO conformance. Note that these resourced must _not_ be QuestionnaireResponse resources; where data is collected in this form, it must first be mapped to resources covered by the GECCO standard before being used for conformance testing.

If the app uses FHIR Questionnaire designed according to this IG for collecting data, the Bundle should also include these Questionnaire resources. These will be used to ascertain whether the set of test data covers all the data-types that could result from the questionnaires after mapping. If the app creates GECCO resources directly without Questionnaires resources, no Questionnaires must be submitted.

### Output

The return value from the conformance test HTTP endpoint depends on whether the test passed or not. A test is considered passed if

1. all required data was correctly submitted, AND
2. all test data resources conform to the declared GECCO profiles, AND
3. (if Questionnaires were submitted) the test data set includes examples of all GECCO profiles declared in the Questionnaires

The output in the two cases is

* **Conformity test passed:** A PDF documents documenting the successful test is returned.
* **Conformity test failed:** A FHIR [OperationOutcome resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/operationoutcome.html) giving result of the validation process, including the errors found.
